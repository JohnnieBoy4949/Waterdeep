Session 1 - Introductions and initiations 
15 June 2023

Agregoth ‘Greg’ the Sagacious, a dispossessed and weathered human wizard, found himself reunited with his long-lost wizarding comrade, Arondir, a woodland hermit of elven descent gifted in the arcane arts. Their paths converged within the Yawning Tavern, where they reminisced about a bygone era together. Tales of their magical education unfolded, with Arondir, a sprightly wood elf of only forty years, representing the younger of the two, while Greg, middle-aged at forty-seven, the more mature.

Durnan, the proprietor of the establishment, a dashing figure boasting a splendid moustache and a physique that can only be obtained from years of adventuring, approached the two wizards. He inquired if they desired pints of ale, his words as concise as his demeanour. With the summer heat permeating the tavern's walls, the wizards gladly accepted. Just at that moment, a young sorcerer of noble lineage, bearing the blood of both elf and human, graced the tavern's entrance. She was promptly guided towards the very same table by the barkeep, for Durnan possessed an inclination for facilitating chance encounters among adventurers. The sorcerer, now introduced as one Manon Lighteye, expressed her preference for a goblet of red wine, though the liquid that ultimately arrived hardly merited such classification. Conversation flowed freely amongst the trio until Ner, a youthful and stalwart paladin of imposing stature, also received Durnan's paternal summons to join the growing gathering.

Yet, before the party of four could truly settle into conversation, an altercation erupted involving a half-orc and five humans. Bald-headed and adorned with eye-shaped tattoos that sprawled across his hairless head and neck, the leader of the humans emerged as a representative of the infamous "Xanathar Guild"! As the clash ensnared the attention of onlookers, Ner, with great effort, managed to navigate through the burgeoning crowd just as the half-orc rendered the tattooed man senseless. In turn, the remaining humans retaliated, incapacitating the orcish combatant. With an authoritative command of simply "out!" issued by the barkeep, the unruly skirmish was promptly quelled, and the humans left, reinstating an atmosphere of tranquillity within the tavern's confines.

This atmosphere would too soon be broken once again as from the depths of the yawning tavern's central chasm emerged a hulking creature, its grotesque flesh being tormented by swarms of bat-like stirges that circled its head. Within the terrified screams of the tavern’s patrons, a young voice could be heard announcing in terror: “It’s a troll!”. Manon, swift and agile, sprung into action, landing a deft, icy strike upon the beast. Arondir, with an equally swift response, invoked a spell of electrifying energy, unleashing arcane power that eradicated a portion of the stirge swarm. Following the lead of his companions, Greg, attempting to fell the troll and send the beast back to its subterranean abode asleep, sent only the remaining stirges into a slumber. Ner, in a valiant effort, swung his heavy morning star with purpose, but missed his mark. Durnan, aware of the perils often concealed beneath his establishment, swiftly retrieved a longsword from behind his bar, poised to vanquish the troll intruder. Fueled by rage, the troll retaliated, tearing into Durnan's shoulder with its dull teeth, before swiping at Manon, rendering her unconscious on the cold stone ground of the tavern. Seeing that the stakes were now swiftly rising, Arondir summoned a firebolt, launching it narrowly past the troll's head. Greg immediately released a barrage of magic missiles toward the malevolent creature. Ner's onslaught continued with his weapon landing upon the troll’s flesh, bringing it to the brink of death. In a display befitting a youthful paladin, Ner declared triumphantly, "Practice time is over!"

Noticing the beast’s proximity to demise, Durnan swung his mighty broadsword once more, but his initial three strikes failed to find their mark. Undeterred, he persisted, unleashing a final surge of determination as he aimed for the creature's head. His blade connected, cleaving the troll's skull in twain. The lifeless beast thudded heavily onto the tavern floor, summoning the faces of wide-eyed patrons who had sought cover behind bar stools and tables. 

Manon, saved from the clutches of death by the skilled attendants of the tavern, lifted herself from the stone below as Durnan addressed the four valiant heroes, proclaiming, "You really are adventurers!"

With newfound wisdom and insight gleaned from their harrowing brush with mortality among faces novel and familiar, questions, both personal and worldly, began to stir within their minds: 

“How might I fight with greater skill, that I may be readied for more such trials in the days to come?”,

“What must stir within the hearts of these young adventurers that brings them to scrupulously thrust themselves into such peril?”,

“Shall I ever find the means to truly prove myself within a world as peculiar and brutal as this?", 

“Does Waterdeep hold within her walls what I seek?”, and 

“Who, indeed, are the Xanathar Guild?”.

As our intrepid adventurers stood in contemplation, the irresistible siren song of Waterdeep, that had lured so many adventurers into her hands before them, rang true within their ears. They sensed the thin thread of their lives entering the tangled tapestry of this city’s enigmas and dramas. Together, they savoured a fleeting interlude in the tranquil aftermath of their inaugural interaction, a moment akin to the calm preceding an impending tempest. Waterdeep, with her bustling streets, her diverse denizens, and her intricate interweaves of heroism and villainy, embraced our adventurers within her perennial palms.
